Things that might happen


####Swipe to transfer to device
If content is being viewed on a mobile device, have different gestures set to transfer to different devices. 

ex. Set swipe up to transfer to my TV; drag fingers apart to send to laptop and TV
etc.


####Time Triggers
Start content playing at a predetermined time. 

ex. Start playing porn at 11 PM on my 50" plasma

####Information about currently playing video on separate device (ie. in sync with video time points)
ex. I'm watching Into The Blue and I look at my phone to see what song is currently playing and that Paul Walker died yesterday

ex. Advertisements

ex. Controls for video

####Put presentation on screen and control from mobile device
Main screen content can be controlled by multiple devices. 

####Hold mobile device in front of TV and video transfers
See: Ironman

####Transfer sections of app interface
ex. If I'm sitting near my computer and I get an email on my phone. I click reply and the compose screen comes up. It's going to be a long reply because some serious shit is about to get said. I transfer that interface to my desktop and use my keyboard to write the email, but ultimately all input is piped back to the phone. 

My initial thought is that this can be acheieved with JS, HTML, CSS, and an embedded browser window on the computer.
